**Library project API automation**

This is an assignment for creating a testing framework using testng and rest assured. This project contains a skeleton framework that needs to be implemented by following the instructions given in the pom file, test classes and utility classes. Instructions are general guidelines that do not go into details. You may have to create more classes, methods, variables based on your judgement. Many test cases do not provide all the steps for building the requests. Refer to the documentation for information related to authentication, request urls, methods, parameters as well as response details. 


**What to do?**

-[ ] Download it as a zip folder. 
-[ ] Import it to your Intellij.
-[ ] Add the dependencies listed in the _pom.xml_ file. 
-[ ] Implement the utility classes. 
-[ ] Implement the base class.
-[ ] Automated the tests. 
-[ ] (Do this last) Project should be able to run tests in different environments.
-[ ] (Do this last) It should be able to read environment value either from the properties file or the command line argument.

> You will have many compilation errors to deal with until you finish implementing the utilities and the base class. Fix those errors before starting to automate test cases. Feel free to make any changes, add/remove classes, methods, variables. You may need to add more utilities.
