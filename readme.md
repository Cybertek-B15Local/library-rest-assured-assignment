**Library project API automation**

This is an assignment for creating a testing framework using testng and rest assured. This project contains a skeleton framework that needs to be implemented by following the instructions given in the pom file, test classes and utility classes. Many test cases do not provide all the steps for building the requests. Refer to the documentation for information related to authentication, request urls, methods, parameters as well as response details.  Instructions are general guidelines that do not go into details. You may have to create additional classes, methods, variables based on your judgement.


> You will have many compilation errors to deal with until you finish implementing the utilities and the base class. Fix those errors before starting to automate test cases. Feel free to make any changes, add/remove classes, methods, variables. You may need to add more utilities.


**What to do?**

- Download the projeect as a zip folder (Don't clone). 
- Import it to your Intellij.
- Add the dependencies listed in the _pom.xml_ file. 
- Implement the utility classes. 
- Implement the base class.
- Project should be able to run tests in different environments.
- It should be able to read environment value either from the properties file or the command line argument.
- Automate the tests.
